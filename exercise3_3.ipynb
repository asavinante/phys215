    "Note first the use of `queue.pop()` which is not constant in time but linear in time such that for a set of length $n$ this is $O(n)$ in performance. As was explained in section 3.9 in the textbook, a faster way to implement this is to use `popleft`. Second, for the conditional expressions used in `queue.extend` this checks if `c` in `G[curr_node]` is in the sequences `visited` and `queue` . This checking is also linear in time such that this conditional expression has a performance $O(n^2)$. Combined with the first error, the total performance of this function is $O(n^3)$."
