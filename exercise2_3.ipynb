Write a version of this function that checks the neighbors before adding them to the stack.  Does this \"optimization\" change the order of growth?  Does it make the function faster?"

    "The modified version of `reachable_nodes` checks whether one of the nodes in `neighbors(node)` is already in seen. This is a linear search which would increase the runtime of the code. However as was explained in exercise 2.2, if the two algorithms have the same leading term then they are equivalent, hence the order of growth would be $O(n+n+m) =O(2n+m) \\approx O(n+m)$. As noted in **Think Python**, for two algorithms with the same leading term the faster one is entirely dependent on the details. In my case, `reachable nodes` has a run time of 11.8 µs ± 87.5 ns per loop while `reachable_nodes_precheck` has a run time of 12.6 µs ± 34.3 ns per loop. The addition of another check added 1.0 µs of run time."
