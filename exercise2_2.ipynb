    "From the provided code,  for `start` grabbing the first element in the list is constant in time. For `reachable`, this is equal to `reachable_nodes` which is classified as $O(n + m)$. For the equivalence between `len(reachable)` and `len(G)`, this is probably linear in term because of the use of **linear search** for unsorted data types. However note that for algorithmic analysis, functions with the same leading term are equivalent hence $O(n+n) = O(n)$. From this the order of growth here is still $O(n+m)$."
